===

Periodically retrieves the top facts from the subreddit 'Today I Learned' (/r/todayilearned/hot) and creates a notification with these facts.

Requires a wearable - the TILs are presented 1 per page, and can be scrolled through, left to right.

On a phone, the notification will only allow dismissing of the TILs. There's a small settings page where the sync refresh interval and number of TILs to retrieve can be configured.
